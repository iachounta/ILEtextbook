# Preface{-}

This resource aims to serve as "*classroom notes*" for the course "Intelligent Learning Environments". It does not aim to substitute other learning materials distributed during the lecture or to replace the in-person lectures. Also, this resource is **by no means** complete or exhaustive. It was put together while taking notes throughout the semester and it is meant to be updated every year.

As such, I would like to acknkowledge and thank the students who shared their own notes over time, and who provided triggers for putting everything together with their emails, questions, and suggestions.

Note: Please don't hesitate to send me feedback for improvements.

To create this learning resource, I used the R package **bookdown** - **bookdown**  can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Happy readings :)
