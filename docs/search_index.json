[["index.html", "Course Textbook: Intelligent Learning Environments Preface", " Course Textbook: Intelligent Learning Environments Irene-Angelica Chounta 2024-08-07 Preface This resource aims to serve as “classroom notes” for the course “Intelligent Learning Environments”. It does not aim to substitute other learning materials distributed during the lecture or to replace the in-person lectures. Also, this resource is by no means complete or exhaustive. It was put together while taking notes throughout the semester and it is meant to be updated every year. As such, I would like to acknkowledge and thank the students who shared their own notes over time, and who provided triggers for putting everything together with their emails, questions, and suggestions. Note: Please don’t hesitate to send me feedback for improvements. To create this learning resource, I used the R package bookdown - bookdown can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Happy readings :) -irene "]]
